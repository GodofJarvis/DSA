# Miller test for prime numbers

This is the fastest way to check if a number is probably prime.

The Miller–Rabin primality test is based on the contrapositive of the above claim. That is, if we can find an a such that

{\displaystyle a^{d}\not \equiv 1{\pmod {n}}}a^{d}\not \equiv 1{\pmod {n}}
and

{\displaystyle a^{2^{r}d}\not \equiv -1{\pmod {n}}}a^{2^{r}d}\not \equiv -1{\pmod {n}}

for all 0 ≤ r ≤ s − 1, then n is not prime.
