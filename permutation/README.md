# Permutation coefficient

Generally permutation of n number is represented by n!, so permutation coefficient of n numbers taken k at time is n!/(n-k)!.

In combination (a,b) is equal to (b,a). So combination coefficient of n numbers taken k at time is n!/(k!*(n-k)!) which is same as dividing permutation formula by k!.
